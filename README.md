# GrowersBrains
GrowersBrains is an app designed to solve the problems that growers globally are Facing and to bring expert growing techniques to everyone. Grow Green and Grow Clean.

As a community project that will enable collaborators to:
- Sharpen their skill sets
- Learn new languages
- Work in a team enviorment
- Get real world experience
- Make something that helps the world
- learn all about the process of taking an app from idea to product
- and most imporantly, have fun along the way.


## Motivation
The way that I came up with the idea, is that I have 15 years of experience of growing plants. Starting in middle school horticulture class at 11 to now at 26, I've learned alot from books and the internet, but the place that I have always learned the most from was other growers teaching me the techniques that took them years to develop and perfect.

That lead me to the idea of creating an app that brings a collective consciousness of Growers together to change the way the world grows. Growing plants can be very expensive and can lead to great losses if not done properly. When done properly it can be a fun, exciting and relaxing way to control the quality of the food or medicine that you are growing and ensure that it is as clean and pure as possible.

## Tech Stack
- React JS
- Node
- MongoDB
- Redux

## Features & Designs
The current design that I have for the app is to have eight different sections.

Sections: 
1) Welcome page that users would have to login to. 
2) Growers Rankings- create rankings of the best growers in the world that could help people with one on one consulting. 
3) Daily Grow- A daily picture of the plants a user is growing allowing to keep an eye on the plants and make sure their healthy, allows to diagnose any problems that arise. 
4) Greenhouse-"What's in your Greenhouse" A locker of all the plants a person is growing and the data of what happens daily, once the plant is done growing a timelapse gets generated. 
5) How to- Articles and videos from the top growers to teach every user the A to Z of growing. 
6) Consulting- Allows top growers an opportunity to connect with new users to help them create a plan to make sure they optimize their grow and everything runs smoothly. 
7) Competition - A daily, weekly, and monthly competition to see who the best grower is in many different categories. 8)Best products- Links and articles reviewing the best products for growers to use that are peer reviewed and approved. With affiliate codes included.


All of these features would allow for great data to be collected and machine learning to be created to diagnose plant problems, and make elite growing accessible to everyone no matter their experience level.
